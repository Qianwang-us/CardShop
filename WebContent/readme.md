## Part 1: Website introduction
In the real life, when we choose post cards for our friends or family, it is hard to get satisfied with design and words on cards at the same time. This website is to solve this problem.

This website with name "iCard" is an e-Commerce website which sells post cards with customized texts to customers. Customer can choose the photo design they like and then enter their own customized texts. We assume the website staff will print out the post cards and deliver to the shipping address.

Suggested sequence to visit pages on the website and description:
1. index.html(home page): customer browse post cards designs and can click heart to add to favorite list, can change display style with dropdown list, click the item photo to go to product.html
2. product.html: customer enter customized text and preview here, click "add to cart" button which adds the item to the shopping cart, go to cart.html
3. cart.html: view all items in shopping cart and manage items, click "proceed to checkout" to continue checkout process, go to shipping_address.html
4. shipping_address.html: choose or edit shipping address, click "Deliver to this address" or "Use this address and checkout" button to go to checkout.html
5. checkout.html: manage items to buy and view order summary, click "place the order" to complete the check out process, go to order_confirm.html
6. order_confirm.html: order is created and show customer order number, click "Have Fun" in the header menu to go to about_us.html
7. about_us.html: Have fun with the animation and new jokes by clicking "get a new joke" button
